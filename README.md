A port of the HaniMandl Code for semi-automated packaging of honey. The original file is here - https://github.com/hiveeyes/hanimandl
I have ported the code to the this board: https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-dev-kit-n8r8.htm
The board works with the 128x128 1.5 inch OLED module https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_OLED_Module
